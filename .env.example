# Copy this file to `.env` and adjust values as needed.
# The front-end will use these values when building/running locally.

# Full URL for the sensor API endpoint. This should include the `/api/sensor`
# path unless you plan to use the development proxy (in which case you can set
# it to "/api/sensor").
#
# **Do not wrap the value in quotes** and avoid spaces around the equals sign; the
# value should be a plain string. Example:
#
#   VITE_API_URL=http://192.168.1.177:5000/api/sensor
#
# or when using the proxy:
#
#   VITE_API_URL=/api/sensor

VITE_API_URL=

# (optional) Override the development proxy target.
# VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET=http://192.168.1.177:5000
